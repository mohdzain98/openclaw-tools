# Axis Bank Spending Tracker

## Description
Use this skill when the user asks to:
- Generate a spending report or weekly summary
- Show how much was spent this week or last week
- Analyze Axis Bank transactions by category or payee/target
- View spending dashboard
- Check food / transport / rent / any category spend
- Run the spending report manually

## Tool: generate_weekly_report

Fetches Axis Bank transaction emails from the last 7 days, categorizes them
using notebook-style regex rules, stores them in SQLite, generates stored-history
dashboards, and sends a WhatsApp summary with the latest dashboard link.

### Usage
```bash
cd /home/zain/zainclaw/axis_spending
python3 axis_tracker.py
```

From a checked-out repo root, this also works:
```bash
python3 zainclaw/axis_tracker.py
```

### Custom date range (optional)
```bash
# Last 14 days
cd /home/zain/zainclaw/axis_spending
python3 axis_tracker.py 14

# Last 30 days
python3 axis_tracker.py 30
```
